## Proxy Scraper
DevBooster includes a proxy scraper tool (`proxy_scraper.py`) that automates the process of scraping and verifying proxies for use in your applications. The script fetches proxies from trusted sources, checks their functionality by making requests to Google, and saves the working proxies to a file named `proxy.txt` in the same directory as the script.

### Usage
1. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the proxy scraper script using:
   ```bash
   python proxy_scraper.py
   ```

3. Use the proxies saved in `proxy.txt` in your applications or scripts for enhanced security and anonymity.
